# FAQ

### How do I know my level?
There is no perfect way to know your exact level, but there are a few handy [guides](assets/pickleball_skill_guide.jpg) to give you a general idea.  

It is best to determine a self-rating, and drop it by half a point if you are looking to join a level specific group for the first time. Once you get comfortable there, feel free to then move up.  

Important note for tennis players! While your tennis experience will help in developing your pickleball game, your current tennis rating is not always the best indication of where your pickleball rating is.  

### How can I update a page of this website?
The info on the website is handcurated by myself from my own experiences playing pickleball in Philadelphia. So it's likely the information is out of date or inaccurate. Any feedback or suggestions is greatly appreciated!

On every page of the website (including this one), there should be an "Edit this page" option in the page navigation bar on the right side. (Make sure you're viewing the page in full screen mode). Clicking this button will take you to the underlying code that makes the page. You can edit the code there by submitting a pull request on Github. Or for the less-savy tech savvy, messaging me on IG at @philly_pickleball works as well.
