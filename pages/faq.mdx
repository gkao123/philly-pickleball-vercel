### How can I update this page?
On every page of the website (including this one), there should be an "Edit this page" option in the page navigation bar on the right side. (Make sure you're viewing the page in full screen mode). Clicking this button will take you to the underlying code that makes the page. You can edit the code there by submitting a pull request on Github. Or for the less-savy tech savvy, messaging me on IG at @philly_pickleball works as well.
