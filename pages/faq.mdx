### How can I update a page of this website?
The info on the website is handcurated by myself from my own experiences playing pickleball in Philadelphia. So it's likely the information is out of date or inaccurate. Any feedback or suggestions is greatly appreciated!

On every page of the website (including this one), there should be an "Edit this page" option in the page navigation bar on the right side. (Make sure you're viewing the page in full screen mode). Clicking this button will take you to the underlying code that makes the page. You can edit the code there by submitting a pull request on Github. Or for the less-savy tech savvy, messaging me on IG at @philly_pickleball works as well.
